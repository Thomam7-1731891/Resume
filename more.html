          Currently, I am an Resident Advisor for the University of Washington Housing Services, helping serve as a student leader
          among my residents. My job includes helping connect students with each other by programming events to facilitate discussion, checking in with their well-being, and acting as a mediator
          for any forms of conflict between students living on campus. In addition, I also work with the UW-IT Accessbility Department as an assistant. The duties of this job include scheduling,
          participating and taking detailed notes on meetings with various companies on accessibility needs for developing products. Fast-paced job that requires knowledge on using accessible
          technology such as screen readers to test various products to see if they meet industry standards on accessibility.
