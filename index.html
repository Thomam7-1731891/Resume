        Passionate in keeping up with technology, coding, and learning new skills everyday.
        Looking for the opportunity to get real work experience in a technical environment. I am a motivated 3rd year college student majoring in Informatics.
        During the course of my academic career, I have acquired almost 2 years of coding experience and have a
        well-rounded technical background that includes database management, understanding how to utilize the design process,
        as well as web development. In addition, I have had the privilege to take on a variety of leadership roles both in group projects, as well as in professional positions.

            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            <p>
              Currently, I am an Resident Advisor for the University of Washington Housing Services, helping serve as a student leader
              among my residents. My job includes helping connect students with each other by programming events to facilitate discussion, checking in with their well-being, and acting as a mediator
              for any forms of conflict between students living on campus.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, I also work with the UW-IT Accessbility Department as an assistant. The duties of this job include scheduling,
              participating and taking detailed notes on meetings with various companies on accessibility needs for developing products. Fast-paced job that requires knowledge on using accessible
              technology such as screen readers to test various products to see if they meet industry standards on accessibility.
